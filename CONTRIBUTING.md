## Project Purpose

This project serves as a controlled environment for practicing Selenium test automation. When contributing, please keep in mind that the primary goal is to provide features that are useful for learning and practicing test automation techniques. Every feature should be designed with testability in mind.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sujithps/demo-store.git
   cd demo-store
   ```
3. The application is static HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no build process needed
4. Open the project in your favorite editor and you're ready to go!

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce it
- Browser and device information
- How this bug impacts Selenium testing (if applicable)

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome ideas for new features, especially those that would create interesting testing scenarios. When suggesting enhancements, please include:

- A clear description of the proposed feature
- How it would benefit testers practicing with Selenium
- Any specific testing scenarios it would enable

### Pull Requests

1. Create a branch with a descriptive name:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/new-product-filter
   ```

2. Make your changes, keeping in mind the project's purpose

3. Test your changes with Selenium if possible

4. Push your branch and create a pull request

## Development Guidelines

To ensure this application remains an effective Selenium testing ground:

### HTML Structure

- Add descriptive `id` and `data-testid` attributes to important elements
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Keep the DOM structure consistent and predictable
- Add appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility testing

### JavaScript

- Use clear, consistent naming
- Add data attributes for dynamic elements
- Document complex interactions
- Keep browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage) usage clear and documented

### UI/UX Design

- Maintain responsive design across all features
- Keep visual feedback clear (loading states, success/error messages)
- Ensure all interactive elements are easily targetable by Selenium

## Selenium Testing Considerations

As this project is specifically designed for Selenium testing, please consider:

### Element Selectors

- Provide stable, descriptive IDs for key elements
- Avoid generating random IDs or classes
- Document element relationships for complex components

### Test Scenarios

- When adding a feature, document possible test scenarios it enables
- Consider edge cases that would be interesting to test
- For complex features, provide example Selenium code if possible

### Test-friendly Features

Some features that are particularly helpful for Selenium practice include:

- Form validations
- Dynamic content loading
- Sortable/filterable lists
- Multi-step processes
- Elements that require explicit waits
- AJAX-simulated interactions

## Communication

- For questions or discussions, open an issue with the "discussion" label
- Join our Discord community (if applicable)
- Check existing issues before opening a new one
